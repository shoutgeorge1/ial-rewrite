H2: FAQs
These answers summarize common questions based on the Playbook and standard California practice.
Short answer: These are common slip and fall questions.
- What if there was no warning sign?
Answer: Each case is unique, but the standard evidence includes medical records, documented symptoms, and liability proof.
- Do I need an incident report?
Answer: An incident report helps document the hazard, but other evidence like photos and witness statements also matters.
- How long do I have to file?
Answer: Most California personal injury claims have a two-year deadline, but government claims and certain malpractice cases can be shorter.
- What if I was partly at fault?
Answer: California uses comparative fault, so recovery is reduced by your share of fault rather than barred entirely.
- Will my case go to court?
Answer: Most cases settle, but trial-ready preparation improves leverage and protects value if litigation is required.
