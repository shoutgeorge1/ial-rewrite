These answers summarize common questions based on the Playbook and standard California practice.
Short answer: These are common proof questions.
- What evidence matters most?
Answer: Strong evidence includes police reports, photos/video, witness statements, and consistent medical documentation.

Answer: Yes. Scene photos, vehicle damage, visible injuries, and daily-life videos can support liability and pain-and-suffering damages.
