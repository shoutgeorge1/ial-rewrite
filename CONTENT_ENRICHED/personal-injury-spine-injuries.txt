Book Insight: Adjusters often start with a low reserve and raise authority in small steps. A strong liability narrative and clean medical timeline help move those internal approvals faster. Book Insight: Adjusters weigh credibility, prior claims, and social media activity. Clear, consistent documentation helps neutralize those objections. 

Book Insight: Adjusters often reduce claim value when treatment is delayed or inconsistent, so documentation matters.
