Quote: "The Adjuster Is Not Your Friend" â€” Shawn S. Rokni, Insider Lawyer Personal Injury Playbook
Book Insight: Gaps in treatment or delayed care are common reasons adjusters reduce value. Consistent records and clear physician notes help protect recovery. Book Insight: Treatment proportionality matters in valuation. Care that matches the injury severity helps avoid devaluation. 

Book Insight: Liability and damages are the two pillars of claim value, and both require objective evidence.

H2: FAQs
These answers summarize common questions based on the Playbook and standard California practice.
Short answer: These are common premises liability questions.
- What if the property owner says they did not know?
Answer: Owners are liable if they knew or should have known. We prove notice with records, photos, and witness statements.
- Do I need an incident report?
Answer: An incident report helps document the hazard, but other evidence like photos and witness statements also matters.
- How long do I have to file?
Answer: Most California personal injury claims have a two-year deadline, but government claims and certain malpractice cases can be shorter.
- What if I was partly at fault?
Answer: California uses comparative fault, so recovery is reduced by your share of fault rather than barred entirely.
- Will my case go to court?
Answer: Most cases settle, but trial-ready preparation improves leverage and protects value if litigation is required.
