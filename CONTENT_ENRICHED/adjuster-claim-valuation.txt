Quote: "Behind the scenes, insurance adjusters are working off a playbook designed to reduce the value of your claim." — Shawn S. Rokni, Insider Lawyer Personal Injury Playbook
Book Insight: Adjusters often start with a low reserve and raise authority in small steps. A strong liability narrative and clean medical timeline help move those internal approvals faster. Book Insight: Adjusters weigh credibility, prior claims, and social media activity. Clear, consistent documentation helps neutralize those objections.
