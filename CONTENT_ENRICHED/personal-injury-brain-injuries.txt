Quote: "Liability and Damages: The Two Pillars of Every Claim" â€” Shawn S. Rokni, Insider Lawyer Personal Injury Playbook
Book Insight: Gaps in treatment or delayed care are common reasons adjusters reduce value. Consistent records and clear physician notes help protect recovery. Book Insight: Treatment proportionality matters in valuation. Care that matches the injury severity helps avoid devaluation.

H2: FAQs
These answers summarize common questions based on the Playbook and standard California practice.

- How do you prove a brain injury after a crash?
