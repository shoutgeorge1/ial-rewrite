Book Insight: Liability and damages are the two pillars of valuation. Objective evidence on both sides is what changes settlement authority. Book Insight: Future medical needs and lost earning capacity must be supported by experts. Well-supported projections carry more weight in negotiation. 

Book Insight: Low initial offers are a common tactic; strong documentation and trial readiness improve authority.

H2: FAQs
These answers summarize common questions based on the Playbook and standard California practice.
Short answer: These are common pedestrian right-of-way questions.
- What if I was outside a crosswalk?
Answer: You may still recover under comparative fault depending on the facts and traffic evidence.
- Can I still recover if I was partly at fault?
Answer: California uses comparative fault, so recovery is reduced by your share of fault rather than barred entirely.
- How long do I have to file?
Answer: Most California personal injury claims have a two-year deadline, but government claims and certain malpractice cases can be shorter.
- What if the driver fled?
Answer: Report the hit-and-run immediately, gather any witness info, and use uninsured motorist coverage if the driver is not identified.
- Will my case go to court?
Answer: Most cases settle, but trial-ready preparation improves leverage and protects value if litigation is required.
