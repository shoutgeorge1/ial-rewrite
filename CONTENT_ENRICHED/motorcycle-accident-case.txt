Book Insight: Demand letters work best when they tell a clear story and anchor a specific number with evidence. Vague demands invite low offers.

H2: FAQs
These answers summarize common questions based on the Playbook and standard California practice.
Short answer: These are common motorcycle accident questions.
- What if the driver says they did not see me?
Answer: Failure to see a visible rider is not a defense. We use right-of-way laws, scene evidence, and visibility analysis to prove negligence.
- Can I recover if I was lane-splitting?
Answer: Lane-splitting is generally legal in California and does not automatically bar recovery.
- How long do I have to file?
Answer: Most California personal injury claims have a two-year deadline, but government claims and certain malpractice cases can be shorter.
- What damages are available for permanent injuries?
Answer: Damages can include medical bills, lost income, future care, and pain and suffering. In wrongful death, families can recover financial support and loss of companionship.
- Will my case go to court?
Answer: Most cases settle, but trial-ready preparation improves leverage and protects value if litigation is required.
