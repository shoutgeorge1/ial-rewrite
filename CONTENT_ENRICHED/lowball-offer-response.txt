H2: FAQs
These answers summarize common questions based on the Playbook and standard California practice.
Short answer: These are common lowball-offer questions.
- Is the first offer usually fair?
Answer: First offers are usually low. We counter with updated medical support and set a response deadline; if they will not move, we file suit.
- Should I respond directly to the adjuster?
Answer: It is better to respond through counsel to avoid recorded statements and preserve negotiation leverage.
- How long should I negotiate before filing suit?
Answer: Most California personal injury claims have a two-year deadline, but government claims and certain malpractice cases can be shorter.
- Will a lawsuit increase my settlement?
Answer: Often, yes. Filing suit increases risk and costs for insurers, which can raise settlement authority.
