Quote: "The less you know about how the system works, the more power they have." — Shawn S. Rokni, Insider Lawyer Personal Injury Playbook

These answers summarize common questions based on the Playbook and standard California practice.

Answer: Proof usually includes medical imaging, specialist evaluations, and records that connect the injury to the incident, plus witness or scene evidence.
