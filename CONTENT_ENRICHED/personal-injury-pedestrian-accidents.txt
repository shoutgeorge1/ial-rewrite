These answers summarize common questions based on the Playbook and standard California practice.
Short answer: These are common pedestrian questions.
- What if I was outside a crosswalk?
Answer: You may still recover under comparative fault depending on the facts and traffic evidence.
- How does comparative fault apply?
Answer: California uses comparative fault, so recovery is reduced by your share of fault rather than barred entirely.
- How long do I have to file?
Answer: Most California personal injury claims have a two-year deadline, but government claims and certain malpractice cases can be shorter.
- What if the driver fled the scene?
Answer: Each case is unique, but the standard evidence includes medical records, documented symptoms, and liability proof.
- Will I have to go to court?
Answer: Most cases settle, but trial-ready preparation improves leverage and protects value if litigation is required.
