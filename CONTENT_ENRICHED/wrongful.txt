Answer: Each case is unique, but the standard evidence includes medical records, documented symptoms, and liability proof.
- How long do we have to file?
Answer: Most California personal injury claims have a two-year deadline, but government claims and certain malpractice cases can be shorter.
- Will the case go to court?
