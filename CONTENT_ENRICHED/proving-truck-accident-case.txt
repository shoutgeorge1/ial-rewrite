H1: Proving a Truck Accident Case
Intro: Building a strong truck accident case requires more than a police report. You must prove liability, document injuries, and identify all insurance coverage. This guide outlines the key proof points and the evidence that matters most in commercial truck crashes.

H2: Key Takeaways
- Liability is the biggest hurdle and must be proven early.
- Black box data, driver logs, and maintenance records are critical.
- Multiple defendants can mean higher coverage and higher value.
- Evidence preservation and early investigation change outcomes.

Quote: "Establishing liability is usually the biggest challenge in a truck accident case." -- Shawn S. Rokni

H2: The Four Elements We Evaluate
Short answer: Liability, impact, injuries, and coverage.
H3: Liability
- Who caused the crash and why
- Comparative fault analysis and defenses
H3: Impact
- Mechanism of injury and crash forces
- Visible vehicle damage and scene evidence
H3: Injuries
- Objective testing, imaging, and specialist opinions
- Causation and aggravation of preexisting conditions
H3: Coverage
- Primary and umbrella policies
- Identifying all available insurance layers

H2: Evidence That Proves Liability
Short answer: Objective data beats speculation.
- Black box (electronic data recorder) downloads
- Driver logs and hours-of-service records
- Maintenance and inspection histories
- Cargo loading documents and weigh tickets
- Dash cams, traffic cameras, and eyewitness statements

H2: When Defendants Deny Fault
Short answer: We use data and testimony to break the story.
- Compare physical evidence to driver statements
- Use reconstruction to show vehicle movement
- Lock in testimony through depositions
Book Insight: The best defense to finger-pointing is early data capture. Once the truck returns to the road, black box data can be overwritten.

H2: Multiple Defendants, Multiple Policies
Short answer: More defendants usually means more coverage.
- Trucking companies often carry $1M+ primary policies
- Umbrella and excess policies can add millions
- We identify every policy and demand disclosure early

H2: FAQs
Short answer: These are common case-building questions.
- What is the single most important piece of evidence?
Answer: Black box data is often the most decisive because it provides objective speed, braking, and steering data before impact.
- Do truck cases usually require a lawsuit?
Answer: Often, yes. Many cases do not settle until litigation is filed and the defense must respond to discovery.
- Can I still recover if I had a preexisting injury?
Answer: Yes. California allows recovery for aggravation of a preexisting condition if the crash made it worse.
