- What if I was outside a crosswalk?
Answer: You may still recover under comparative fault depending on the facts and traffic evidence.
- How long do I have to file?
Answer: Most California personal injury claims have a two-year deadline, but government claims and certain malpractice cases can be shorter.
- Can I recover if I was partly at fault?
Answer: California uses comparative fault, so recovery is reduced by your share of fault rather than barred entirely.

Answer: Most cases settle, but trial-ready preparation improves leverage and protects value if litigation is required.
- What damages can I recover?
Answer: Damages can include medical bills, lost income, future care, and pain and suffering. In wrongful death, families can recover financial support and loss of companionship.
