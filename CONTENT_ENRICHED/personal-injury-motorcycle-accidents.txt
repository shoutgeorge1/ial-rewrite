Quote: "The Lowball First Offer Won't Be the Last" â€” Shawn S. Rokni, Insider Lawyer Personal Injury Playbook
Book Insight: Adjusters often start with a low reserve and raise authority in small steps. A strong liability narrative and clean medical timeline help move those internal approvals faster. Book Insight: Adjusters weigh credibility, prior claims, and social media activity. Clear, consistent documentation helps neutralize those objections. 

Book Insight: Adjusters often reduce claim value when treatment is delayed or inconsistent, so documentation matters.

H2: FAQs
These answers summarize common questions based on the Playbook and standard California practice.
Short answer: These are common rider questions.
- What if the driver says they did not see me?
Answer: Failure to see a visible rider is not a defense. We use right-of-way laws, scene evidence, and visibility analysis to prove negligence.
- Can I still recover if I was lane-splitting?
Answer: Lane-splitting is generally legal in California and does not automatically bar recovery.
- How long do I have to file?
Answer: Most California personal injury claims have a two-year deadline, but government claims and certain malpractice cases can be shorter.
- What damages are available for permanent injuries?
Answer: Damages can include medical bills, lost income, future care, and pain and suffering. In wrongful death, families can recover financial support and loss of companionship.
- Will my case go to court?
Answer: Most cases settle, but trial-ready preparation improves leverage and protects value if litigation is required.
